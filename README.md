# Stargazers-Insurance-Company (UNFINISHED)

This is a joke website that I'm working on. Mainly to practise, learn and master my programming skills while creating stuff that I like and I think it is funny. The images inside mainly consist of myself or my friends and any information inside it are mainly for joking purposes and should NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

# Front-end tool that I am using for this project is:
Vite (Yet again, I love vite)
